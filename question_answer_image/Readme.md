# Image Question Answering with BLIP-2

This project leverages the BLIP-2 (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate answers to complex questions about images. By combining state-of-the-art image processing and natural language understanding, the code enables you to ask detailed questions about an image and receive an accurate, human-readable response.

## Features
- **BLIP-2 Model**: Uses the `Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xl` model for question answering from images.
- **Simple Interface**: Easily generate answers by providing an image path and a text-based question.
- **Pretrained Model**: No need to train the model yourself, simply use the pretrained version from Hugging Face.

## Usage
The function `generate_answer(image_path, question)` takes an image and a question as input, processes the image, and generates a relevant answer.
